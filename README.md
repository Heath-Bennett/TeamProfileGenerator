# Team Profile Generator

&nbsp;

## Program Description

This program runs from the command line. It prompts the user for the name, position, id number,  and email address of each team member.  If a team member's role is manager the user is also prompted for office number.  If a team member's role is engineer the user is also prompted for GitHub username. Finally, if the team member is an intern the user is prompted for the school attended. The program then takes the information collected and creates an html page that contains individual cards containing information for each team member.
